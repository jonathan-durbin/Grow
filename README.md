# Grow
Grow is a text-based adventure game which can be modified during play. It was inspired by the article on [Page 90](https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1980-01/Creative_Computing_v06_n01_1980_Jan?ui=embed#page/n93/mode/1up) of the January 1980 edition of the magazine *Creative Computing*.

While this version of the game is backwards compatiable with the version described in the original article, it adds several new features to enrich the experience:

1. A GUI which displays the text-based game, as well as an optional image for each scene. The game can be played in a text only mode by running it with the `-t` flag.
2. A drag and drop interface for importing images to scenes.
3. A drag and drop interface for exporting and importing adventures, which are stored in ZIP files.
2. More commands which allow for easier editing of the adventure.
